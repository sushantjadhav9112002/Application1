# Rule Engine Application

This is a 3-tier rule engine application built using the MERN stack. It allows you to create, combine, and evaluate dynamic rules for determining user eligibility based on various attributes such as age, department, income, and spend. The rules are represented as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and can be modified dynamically.

## Features
- **Create Rule**: Define new rules using simple conditional logic.
- **Combine Rules**: Combine multiple rules into a single AST for efficient evaluation.
- **Evaluate Rules**: Use JSON data to evaluate whether a user meets the eligibility criteria defined by the rules.
- **Dynamic Rule Modification**: Modify existing rules and sub-expressions in the AST.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (Latest version)
- **Backend**: Node.js (v20) with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (Atlas)
- **ORM**: Mongoose
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **API Testing**: Postman or similar tools
